# This is Bite Party.

This is an app that we made that makes it easier to find places to eat with friends! People can swipe left or right like a dating app on different kinds of restaurants nearby!
It was created using React Native and connects to Firebase. We used many APIs in this app - including the Google Maps API and Google Places API. We also made use of the Yelp Fusion API.
The app is live on the App Store and the Google Play Store. There are many new exciting things in the pipeline right now to make the app even better!
